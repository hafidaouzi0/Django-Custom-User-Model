# Django-Custom-User-Model
in this repo there's the source code that i implemented to practice the concept of the user model  that supports multiple different users in django
#at first i implemented : user proxy model: the new table of the model doesn't get created , we only use the existing user table provided by django
#then i practiced another way where i created an additional table and connect it to the user model by one to one relationship and that allowed me to extend the data that i can store about a particular user
